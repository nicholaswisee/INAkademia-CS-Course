# INAkademia CS Course

## Description

This repository acts as an archive for my participation in the INAkademia Summer Bridge CS online course for 2 weeks. There are 2 main assignments, with the first being associated with introductory Python and the second going over slightly advanced Python concepts such as file reading.

There are no requirements to run the files inside `assignment-1`, but make sure to run `pip install matplotlib` when running `main.py` in `assignment-2`.
